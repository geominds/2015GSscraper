# Scrape 2015 results

This simple node script allows you to scrape 2015 election results from the result website.

## Running

Running is not required as I've already run it once and uploaded the results in the data folder. It'd be a crime to waste server resources by running the script again and again while you can just download the same.

```bash
npm install
mkdir data
node scraper.js
```

You'll find data in data folder
